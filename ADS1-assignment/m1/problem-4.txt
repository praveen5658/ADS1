This is possible in Weighted Quick union with path compression with zero unioin statements. It is the basic sequence of nodes.

2. 7 3 8 3 4 5 6 8 8 1
This is not possible because it is failed to satisfy the basic weighted Quick union i.e less size tree should be child for high sized tree.(parent)

3. 6 3 8 0 4 5 6 9 8 1
This is not possible because it is failed to satisfy the basic weighted Quick union i.e less size tree should be child for high sized tree.(parent)

4. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This is possible in Weighted Quick union with path compression. We will get the size array with 10 as value in zeroth index.
5. 9 6 2 6 1 4 5 8 8 9
This is not possible because it is failed to satisfy the basic weighted Quick union i.e less size tree should be child for high sized tree.(parent) and results to circular loop and we can't reach all nodes with root components.

6. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
This is not possible because it will lead to circular loop and we can't get the weighted quick union with compression tree.
